# CHANGE TYPE: MAJOR

## Summary of Changes

-> Recursively removing a directory is now MUCH better thanks to better symlink handling

-> More logs provided while extraction, compressing and deleting dir recursively

-> Fixed a few archivecontrol functions

-> Some more refactoring as usual (check out kbinput.c for more)

-> Made compression of directory recursive by default now (no time loss)
