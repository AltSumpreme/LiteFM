# CHANGE TYPE: MAJOR

## Summary of Changes

-> Fixed some issues with `G` and `gg` keys to properly scroll and show the item highlighted

-> Refactored a LOT of code (not done yet obviously)

-> Removed some unnecessary functions and all deductions of getting file_type is through `is_readable_extension` function

-> Made `structs.h` to ensure that all headers can access all typedefs initialized

-> Subsequent changes to build files
