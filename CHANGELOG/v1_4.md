# CHANGE TYPE: MEDIUM

## Summary of Changes

-> Can now finally traverse the ENTIRE FS (before we could not traverse beyond the current dir where litefm is launched)

-> Added seamless transition to $EDITOR of the UNIX system that works within LiteFM itself (opens a file in $EDITOR, use that and when exited, comes right back to LiteFM dir)

-> Full implementation and testing of `GO-TO` function and decent error logging

-> Some `build.sh` fix
