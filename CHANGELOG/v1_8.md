# CHANGE TYPE: MAJOR 

## Summary of Changes

-> Fixed a bug: If dir had a readable extension it would try to read it as a file (Completely fixed now)

-> Made the `move_file_or_dir` much more transient (now you can traverse to the destination directory rather than typing it out)

-> Editor can be launched for anything except for `is_image` files

-> Added some unicode to `show_term_message` function calls

-> Finally fixed `Makefile`

-> Updated `displayHelp` (added 2 screens for it)

-> Updated man page for litefm
