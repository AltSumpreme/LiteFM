# CHANGE TYPE: MAJOR

## Summary of Changes

-> `copyFileContents` can also copy directories (rsync ofc) so ensured that the proper implementation of dirs/files copy without an issue

-> Added some restrictions to `LiteFM` as a whole, now you cannot traverse a directory that you do not have access to (`access(realpath, R_OK)` must be allowed)

In the future, will try to add some sort of sudo functionality to litefm for seamless traversal but this feature felt very needed.

-> Changed `build.sh`, `Makefile`, `CMakeLists.txt` to accomodate for debians `libncursesw5-dev` package as that is the pkg that can display unicode properly in debian

-> File/Dir Info && File Preview will NOT work for directories that are locked for the user (similar to point 2 you cannot traverse them as well)

-> Fixed the issue of improper resizing of litefm when a window closes in same workspace [WM]

-> Made the logs much MORE verbose

-> Set up command line arguments (very basic)

ISSUE FOUND:

Something goes wrong when trying to traverse `/usr/lib`, `/usr/include/` and similar `/usr` directories. Have not found it elsewhere YET.

This issue seems to be due to dynamically linked files/executables....
